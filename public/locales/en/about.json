    "title": "My Journey",
    "content": [
      "As a thermal engineer and PhD in fluid mechanics, I chose to trade my theoretical calculations for direct contact with materials. This career change to carpentry answered two deep aspirations: the desire to learn to work better with my hands using this noble material that is wood, and a genuine fascination for the Art of Timber Framing Layout.",
      "This ancestral discipline, which allows creating 3D geometry with deceptively simple tools, captivated the mathematician I have always been. Trained at the Association Ouvri√®re des Compagnons du Devoir, I obtained a professional qualification in wood construction as well as a vocational diploma in timber framing."
